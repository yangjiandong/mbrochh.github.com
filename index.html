</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I just came across <a href="http://pydanny.com/developer-time.html">Daniel Greenfeld's post about Developer time</a>
and I thought I might add my two cents to the discussion:</p>
<p>I believe that there are good ways to maximise developer time, they might just
not work in traditional office jobs.</p>
<p>At my company, <a href="http://www.bitmazk.com">Bitmazk</a>, we achieve this by three
means:</p>
<h2>1. Distributed team</h2>
<p>We are a distributed team. I'm sitting in Singapore, Tobi and Daniel are
sitting in Germany... and if you knew our crazy sleeping patterns, you might as
well argue that even Tobi and Daniel are living in different timezones.</p>
<p>The bad thing about this situation is, that it is very hard to create and
maintain a good company culture. We recently bought Nexus 7 devices for
everyone and use them as little windows into our virtual office. Our idea is
to just let a Google Hangout running all the time and whenever someone wakes
up, he will join and say hi. This gives you kind of a feeling like "going to
the office".</p>
<p>The good thing about this is, if you don't want to be interrupted, you simply
quit Skype and IRC and you do your work. The key is trust. Just because I don't
see Tobi being online at 1pm (his time) doesn't mean that he is slacking off.
I will just assume that whatever he does is in the best interest of the
company.</p>
<h2>2. IRC for near-synchronous communication</h2>
<p>We use IRC as our main communication tool. Everyone is free to chose a client
of choice but it is encouraged to use <a href="http://irccloud.com">irccloud.com</a>.
First of all it is another tool moved into the cloud. The only program left
that I actually have to install from CD when setting up a new machine is
Photoshop. I can't wait for this sucker to die as well (I'm looking at you,
Chromebook!).</p>
<p>Secondly it functions as a bouncer. This means, when you close the browser tab,
no one will notice it. Irccloud will keep you online forever. This also means
that when you login the next time, you can scroll back all the history in all
your channels and see what you have missed. It is <em>really</em> awesome. There even
is TapChat, an awesome Android client who can connect via irccloud and will
soon offer push notifications.</p>
<p>Our rules for IRC are simple: We do not expect anyone to look at the chat,
ever. If you want the attention of someone, nudge him by writing his name. He
will hear a beep or see a desktop notification and if he is free, he will
answer. If he is not free, which is the more common case, he will mention your
name as well, when answering minutes or hours later.</p>
<p>Again: The beep or notification is a minimal distraction and usually by just
peeping at the message for a split second you can safely decide if the question
is important and would justify a conversation or if you would rather like to
stick with your code.</p>
<p>And of course, you can opt out. Just close IRC.</p>
<h2>3. Email and mailing list for asynchronous communication</h2>
<p>Every now and then it happens that you hit an obstacle you just can't solve
yourself. In the old office world, you would visit the nerdy genius colleague
who always knows all answers to all questions and disturb him. In the new
world you have to stop this task and send an email.</p>
<p>For things that are not of greater interest to the team, we would send an email
to a person, for topics that might need a discussion or are just too cool
to get lost in someone's inbox, we send a mail to our internal mailing list.</p>
<p>Did you know that you can start closed invite only Google Groups these days?
Yep! Setting up an awesome, easy to use, easy to manage and searchable mailing
list has never been easier.</p>
<p>There is a catch: This only works because everyone is allowed to work on
anything at any time. We don't have a hierarchy nor do we have job
descriptions, other than "be great", maybe. Therefore, if you hit a wall, you
can just turn around and walk into another direction, solve another one of our
never ending cards on Trello. Speaking of Trello:</p>
<h2>4. We use trello.com</h2>
<p>We don't do meetings. Of course we have Skype sessions or hangouts whenever
we need to plan something and typing it all into IRC would just be too slow,
but apart from that, there are no meetings. Ever. Meetings are evil. When I
was working for a large multinational corporation for 6 years I think I did not
attend a single meeting that was worth the time. Even at the much cooler,
smaller and hipper company I worked for after that, basically 99% of all
meetings were time wasted.</p>
<p>Why is that? It's the managers, stupid! In most companies meetings serve the
single purpose of gathering everyone in one sport and reporting their progress
so that the manager knows whats going on.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://trello.com">trello.com</a> for the rescue! Trello solves <em>so many</em>
problems, but above all it allows me (the manager), to asnwer the question
"So, what are you currently working on?" with a single click. I don't need
to disturb anyone for this. Even better. I can <em>remote control</em> my team by
writing these cute little cards. Sometimes I can see in real time how the
card is being picked up by a member and moved to the "Doing" list, then to
the "Done" list. It's a blessing!</p>
<p>Seriously, if I ever meet Joel Spolsky in person, I will fall on my knees and
praise him for giving us stackoverflow <em>and</em> Trello. These are probably the two
most important sites that allow me and my team to pursue the dream that we are
currently living.</p>
<p>By the way, I believe that the guys at 37 signals and at Github work in a very
similar way, they even published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ReWork-ebook/dp/B003ELY7PG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354795715&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=rework">a book about it</a>. 
Sure, that book is old news today and in the end it's just marketing - but at
the same time it is actually true and it simply works.</p>
<p>I hope this gives you some inspiration. If anyone should be in a position to
maximize developer time, I believe it should be you, Daniel. The tools are all
there. And they are free!</p><p>There are <a href="./2012/12/re-developer-time.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>
